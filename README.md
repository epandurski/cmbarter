"Circular Multilateral Barter" (CMB) is server-side software for
managing peer-to-peer trading networks. CMB is aimed at supplying
entrepreneurs with a way to exchange goods and services within a
p2p-network, without using money, overcoming the "double coincidence
of wants" problem, inherent to traditional barter.

Most importantly, CMB allows traders to issue their own currencies
(called "products"), which others can redeem, trade, or make payments
with. One thing that distinguishes CMB from other "credit commons" is
that all debts in CMB are user-to-user debts. There is no central
administrative authority to decide who deserves to be trusted and who
does not. Because of this, CMB can scale-up very well, so that local
communities can be seamlessly aggregated into larger ones.

Another way of seeing CMB is as a partnership of independent Local
Exchange Trading Systems, having a common marketplace for exchanging
one LETS-currency for another (via circular trade).


Features:

* Does not suffer the double coincidence of wants problem. The trader
  you deliver goods to and the trader you obtain what you need from do
  not need to be the same person, so there is much more flexibility
  for arranging trades. That is: you supply products to customers who
  trust you, and you receive products from partners whom you trust.

* Invulnerable to sudden changes in the value of money. CMB uses money
  solely as a standard of value for a short period of time (typically
  a day).

* Allows users to issue their own currencies (called
  "products"). Therefore, trading is not limited by the global
  scarcity of money or any other commodity.

* Users can make direct payments to each other. 

* Convenient to use on smartphones. Works even on very old phones (WAP
  2.0).

The easiest way to install CMB is from
