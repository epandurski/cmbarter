Installation on a dedicated server
===================================

Using a dedicated server (or servers) is the preferred way of
installing *Circular Multilateral Barter* (CMB). This method gives the
maximum amount of control, flexibility, and privacy. It is the
recommended approach in all cases where maintaining dedicated
server(s) is feasible.

Before you start the installation, you should download and copy CMB's
source code in your */usr/local/share/* directory::

  # cd /usr/local/share/
  # wget http://sourceforge.net/projects/cmb/files/tarballs/\
  cmbarter-1.14.tar.gz/download -O cmbarter-1.14.tar.gz
  ...

  # tar -xzf cmbarter-1.14.tar.gz 
  # mv cmbarter-1.14 cmbarter

Also, make sure a *Python 2.7* interpreter is installed on your
server.


Application installation
-------------------------

Here are the installation steps that you should perform:
      
1. Install the *Python 2* versions of the following software packages:

   - *Django* (Versions from 1.4 to 1.11 have been tested; chances are
     that newer versions will work too.)
   - *psycopg2* (version 2.3 at least)
   - *Pillow* (or "Python Imaging Library")
   - *pycrypto* [1]_
   - *pytz*

   For example [2]_::
   
     # apt-get install python-django
     ...
        
     # apt-get install python-psycopg2
     ...

     # apt-get install python-imaging
     ...

     # apt-get install python-crypto
     ...

     # apt-get install python-tz
     ...

2. Create *cmbarter* unix user. For example::

     # adduser cmbarter --system --group
     ...

3. Change the owner of */usr/local/share/cmbarter* to *cmbarter*::
    
     # chown cmbarter -R /usr/local/share/cmbarter
     # chgrp cmbarter -R /usr/local/share/cmbarter
      
4. Restrict access to those source files that may contain sensitive
   information::
   
     # chmod og-r /usr/local/share/cmbarter/cmbarter/settings.py
      
5. Create the directory that will contain django's session files::

     # mkdir /var/tmp/cmbarter
     # chown cmbarter /var/tmp/cmbarter
     # chgrp cmbarter /var/tmp/cmbarter
     # chmod og-rx /var/tmp/cmbarter

  
Web server installation
------------------------

Although CMB should work well with all kinds of web servers, this
document focuses specifically on running CMB with *Apache*. Therefore,
having prior experience with administering Apache would be of help.

Here are the installation steps that you should perform:
              
1. Install Apache and make sure the following modules are active:

   - *mod_mime*
   - *mod_dir*
   - *mod_alias*
   - *mod_expires*
   - *mod_ssl*
   - *mod_headers*
   - *mod_rewrite*
   - *mod_include*
   - *mod_reqtimeout*
   - *mod_authz_host*
   
   Make sure *mod_deflate* is NOT ACTIVE.

2. Install and activate *mod_wsgi* [3]_. Make sure mod_wsgi uses the
   *Python 2.7* interpreter, and not the *Python 3.x* one.

   For example::

     # apt-get install libapache2-mod-wsgi
     ...

3. Set the variable "PYTHONHASHSEED" to "random" in Apache's execution
   environment.

   For example::

     # echo "export PYTHONHASHSEED=random" >> /etc/apache2/envvars

4. Obtain a proper SSL certificate for your server.

5. Use the prototype configuration in
   */usr/local/share/cmbarter/apache/httpd.conf* to configure your
   Apache. Notice that you will have to make some changes to the
   prototype configuration in order to adapt it to your specific
   setup. In particular, do not forget to replace "yourdomainname.foo"
   with your real domain name.

6. Consider installing and configuring a firewall (*iptables* for
   example) to protect your web-server from denial-of-service
   attacks. [4]_
   

Mail server installation
-------------------------

CMB needs a mail server only for sending outgoing e-mails. Therefore,
you may install whatever server is most convenient for you [5]_. The
only requirement is that the server is configured to accept anonymous
connections at *localhost:25*.


Database server installation
-----------------------------

CMB relies on the *PostgreSQL* open source database server to hold its
data.  You do not need to know very much about PostgreSQL to install
CMB, but you definitely should obtain some experience in administering
PostgreSQL databases in order to keep your users' data safe and
secure.

Here are the installation steps that you should perform:

1. Install PostgreSQL (version 8.3 at least).  

   Keep in mind that the default PosgreSQL configuration is not very
   well suited for large database servers. So, you will probably need
   to edit your PosgreSQL configuration files at some point [6]_. See
   PostgreSQL's documentation for more info.
   
2. Create a database user *cmbarter* and a database *cmbarter*
   belonging to this user. For example::

     # su postgres

     $ createuser cmbarter
     ...

     $ createdb --owner=cmbarter cmbarter "The CMB database"
     ...

     $ exit

3. Create the necessary objects in the database schema. Make sure they
   are all owned by the *cmbarter* database user::

     # sudo -u cmbarter psql -d cmbarter

     cmbarter=> \cd /usr/local/share/cmbarter/pgsql
     cmbarter=> create language plpgsql;
     ...

     cmbarter=> \i schema.sql
     ...

     cmbarter=> \i triggers.sql
     ...

     cmbarter=> \i views.sql
     ...

     cmbarter=> \i sprocs.sql
     ...
                
4. If your users' primary language is other than English, you can use
   the *set_language.py* script to create a new default text-search
   configuration for that language.
 

Application configuration
--------------------------

Here are the configuration steps that you should perform:
      
1. Review and edit your
   */usr/local/share/cmbarter/cmbarter/settings.py* file — the CMB
   configuration is held there.

2. Add the following lines to your system *crontab*::

     0,10,20,30,40,50 * * * * sudo -u cmbarter python /usr/local/share...
       /cmbarter/execute_turn.py

     * * * * * sudo -u cmbarter python /usr/local/share/cmbarter/check...
       _sessions.py --repeat-interval=5

     * * * * * sudo -u cmbarter python /usr/local/share/cmbarter/proce...
       ss_emails.py
   
   Call each script [7]_ with "--help" to see its full list of
   accepted parameters.
   
   Notice that the system crontab format might be slightly different
   on your system. Also, make sure "python" runs the *Python 2.7*
   interpreter, and not the *Python 3.x* one.



   
Installation on a shared server
================================

Although using a dedicated server is the preferred way of installing
*Circular Multilateral Barter* (CMB), sometimes maintaining your own
server is not feasible. In such cases, an installation on a shared
server is a perfectly acceptable, and fully functional alternative.


Choosing a hosting provider
----------------------------

Choosing appropriate hosting provider for your installation is
probably the most difficult step. Here are some important things that
you should look for:

* They must have real experience in hosting *Python* web
  applications. Many providers are narrowly specialized in hosting PHP
  applications. You should avoid them.

* They must support *PostgreSQL* databases.

* They must support *FastCGI*.

* They must use *Apache*. Although you could configure CMB to work
  with other web servers, Apache is the safe bet.

* They must give you *SSH* access to your user account. Although you
  could manage to install CMB without SSH access, not having it is a
  huge obstacle.

CMB is quite efficient in using system resources, so you probably will
not need more than few gigabytes of disk and database space.


Application installation
-------------------------

Here are the installation steps that you should perform:
      
1. Make sure a *Python 2.7* interpreter is installed on the hosting
   server. Also, make sure the *Python 2* versions of the following
   software packages are installed:

   - *Django* (Versions from 1.4 to 1.11 have been tested; chances are
     that newer versions will work too.)
   - *psycopg2* (version 2.3 at least)
   - *Pillow* (or "Python Imaging Library")
   - *pycrypto*
   - *pytz*
   - *flup*

   Often some of the packages will be missing on the hosting
   server. Therefore you should either be able to convince
   administrators to install them for you, or be able to set up a
   customized local Python environment for yourself (using
   *virtualenv* for example).

2. Download and copy CMB's source code in your home directory. For
   example::

     $ cd ~
     $ wget http://sourceforge.net/projects/cmb/files/tarballs/\
     cmbarter-1.14.tar.gz/download -O cmbarter-1.14.tar.gz
     ...

     $ tar -xzf cmbarter-1.14.tar.gz 
     $ mv cmbarter-1.14 cmbarter

3. Restrict access to those source files that may contain sensitive
   information::
   
     $ chmod og-r ~/cmbarter/cmbarter/settings.py
      
4. Create the directory that will contain django's session files::

     $ mkdir ~/tmp/cmbarter
     $ chmod og-rx ~/tmp/cmbarter

  
Apache configuration
---------------------

Here are the configuration steps that you should perform:
              
1. Obtain and install a proper SSL certificate for your site. To do
   this, you will probably have to buy a dedicated IP address from
   your hosting provider.

2. Copy or link *~/cmbarter/static/* and *~/cmbarter/doc/* to your web
   root directory. For example::

     $ ln -s ~/cmbarter/static/ ~/public_html/static
     $ ln -s ~/cmbarter/doc/ ~/public_html/doc

3. Copy *~/cmbarter/apache/cmbarter.fcgi* to your web root
   directory. Make sure it is executable. For example::

     $ cp ~/cmbarter/apache/cmbarter.fcgi ~/public_html/
     $ chmod a+x ~/public_html/cmbarter.fcgi

   You will need to make some changes in the newly created
   *cmbarter.fcgi* file in order to adapt it to your specific
   setup. Do not forget to replace "yourusername" with your real
   username.

4. Add the content of *~/cmbarter/apache/htaccess* to your *.htaccess*
   file in the web root directory. For example::

     $ cat ~/cmbarter/apache/htaccess >> ~/public_html/.htaccess

   You will need to make some changes in the *.htaccess* file in order
   to adapt it to your specific setup. Do not forget to replace
   "yourdomainname.foo" with your real domain name.
   

Email configuration
--------------------

CMB needs a mail server only for sending outgoing e-mails. Therefore,
the only needed configuration is to create one email account on the
outgoing mail server: "noreply@yourdomainname.foo".


Database configuration
-----------------------

Here are the configuration steps that you should perform:

1. Create a new PostgreSQL database. To do this, you will probably
   have use whatever tools have been given to you by your hosting
   provider.

2. Create the necessary objects in the database schema. For example::

     $ cd ~/cmbarter/pgsql/
     $ psql -d yourdatabase
     
     yourdatabase=> create language plpgsql;
     ...

     yourdatabase=> \i schema.sql
     ...

     yourdatabase=> \i triggers.sql
     ...

     yourdatabase=> \i views.sql
     ...

     yourdatabase=> \i sprocs.sql
     ...
                

Application configuration
--------------------------

Here are the configuration steps that you should perform:
      
1. Review and edit your *~/cmbarter/cmbarter/settings.py* file — the
   CMB configuration is held there.

2. Add the following lines to your *cron* jobs::

     0,10,20,30,40,50 * * * * python ~/cmbarter/execute_turn.py

     * * * * * python ~/cmbarter/check_sessions.py

     * * * * * python ~/cmbarter/process_emails.py --smtp='mailserve...
       rname' --smtp-username='noreply@yourdomainname.foo' --smtp-pa...
       ssword='yourpassword'
   
     0 * * * * touch ~/public_html/cmbarter.fcgi

   Do not forget to replace the dummy data with your real data. Call
   each script with "--help" to see its full list of accepted
   parameters.




Maintenance
============

In CMB, all application-level maintenance tasks are automated. There
are, however, at least two important tasks, that you should figure out
how to do by yourself. Those are:

* Database backups

* Traffic, and system load data analysis

You will be able to find lots of good open source tools performing
these tasks, though.



.. [1] CMB tries its best to support PyPy. If *pycrypto* is not
   available, CMB will use its own pure-python AES cipher
   implementation. Also, if *psycopg2* is not available CMB will try
   to use *psycopg2cffi* instead.
 
.. [2] The examples given here are for *Debian*. If you use another
   operating system, the exact commands that do the work might be
   different.

.. [3] You can not use *mod_wsgi* with PyPy. To use Apache with PyPy,
   you may configure *mod_proxy* to operate as a reverse proxy for a
   separate PyPy-compatible WSGI server (*gunicorn* for example). You
   may consider using *nginx* as well.
 
.. [4] Here is a simplistic, but informative *iptables* configuration
   that limits the number of new connections from one IP address over
   a time period::
   
     # iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -m conntrack \
     --ctstate RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT

     # iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -m recent \
     --update --seconds 60 --hitcount 60 -j DROP

     # iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -m recent --set

   Also, while CMB is working, it maintains a whitelist of "good" IP
   addresses. You can use this auto-generated whitelist to configure
   *iptables* to further protect your web-server (see the
   *show_whitelist.py* command-line tool).

.. [5] Debian uses the *exim* mail server by default. You can
   reconfigure it with this command::

     # dpkg-reconfigure exim4-config
     ...

.. [6] You may consider changing the following parameters:
   *maintainance_work_mem, shared_buffers , effective_cache_size,
   checkpoint_segments, checkpoint_timeout,
   checkpoint_completion_target, effective_io_concurrency,
   random_page_cost*

.. [7] The important commands are: *execute_turn.py,
   process_emails.py, check_sessions.py, generate_regkeys.py,
   schedule_turns.py, show_whitelist.py, show_emails.py,
   set_language.py*. "manage.py" is Django's standard administration
   tool.
